## Smart Rockets

This is a python port of the smart rockets project from The Coding Train found [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/main/CodingChallenges/CC_029_SmartRockets/P5)

Using a genetic algorithm the "rocket" objects attempt to find the target at the top of the screen. They must also avoid a barrier.
